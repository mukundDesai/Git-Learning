VCS-GIT
Why VCS? - To track the changes in files and project within an environment of multiple devs.

VCS answers these 5 questions ----
1. Who made the changes?
2. What has changed? 
3. Where is the change applied? -- not just the file but version and branches as well. 
4. When was the change made?
5. Why was the change made?

History of VCS -- local, centralized, decentralized.
Problem with centralized is that every time the person needs to connect to the server to access data.
Decentraized or distributed is basically local + centralized.
In Distributed local machine also works as a server i.e the dev can work on the files even without connecting to the main repo.
There is a concept of local and centralized repo in decentralized.

Git is a decentralized VCS.


git - working directory, staging area and repository 
staging area - keeps track of what to be next commit(basically after git add it is in staging area)
after u commit only the local repo keeps the version history. The remote server is not effected.

look into ssh keys
